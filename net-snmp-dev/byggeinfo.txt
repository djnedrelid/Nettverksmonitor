	***************************************************************************

	Linking in an snmplib built to use the Multithreaded DLL runtime library to
	an application configured for the Debug Multithreaded DLL runtime library
	results in a link error along the lines of 'defaultlib "MSVCRT" conflicts
	with use of other libs'.   If you receive a similar message, check that the
	projects settings between library and application match up.

	To successfully build your existing project with Net-SNMP libraries,
	change the project settings FOR YOUR APPLICATION ONLY as follows:

	   1. In the Link section, Select "Additional Libraries".
		  Add netsnmp.lib for Release version.
		  Add netsnmp_d.lib for Debug version.

	   2. Remove all references to these libraries:
		  libsnmp*.lib msvcrt*.lib libc*.lib oldnames.lib

	   3. In the C++ section, Select "Code Generation".
		  For Release, select /MD or "MultiThreaded DLL".
		  For Debug, select /MDd or "Debug MultiThreaded DLL".

	   4. Make sure "Ignore all default libraries" is NOT SET.

	   5. Make sure "_MBCS" is included in your pre-processor defines.

	Note: Some users may have better results compiling other packages that use
		  the installed header files by removing the "mode_t" definition from
		  net-snmp-config.h file in the installed directories.
